# COMPETITION: Clasiffication of CIFAR-10 dataset with Neural Networks.
Mini-"Kaggel" Competition within The Bridge, Data Science Bootcamp April's 2020 edition.
    The rules are simple: Importing CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras and obtainning the best accuracy without trainning the Neural Networks with the test subset.The best approach, is the use of pre-trained NN, as VGG-16, and adding a classification DNN on top of them. 
    Here are my results:
