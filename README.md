# COMPETITION: Clasiffication of CIFAR-10 dataset with Neural Networks

Competition done in the DataScience Bootcamp of The Bridge. 
The rules are simple: Importing CIFAR-10 dataset from Keras and obtainning the best accuracy without trainning the Neural Networks with the test subset.
The best approach, is the use of pre-trained NN as VGG-16 and adding a classification DNN on top of them.
Here my results.
